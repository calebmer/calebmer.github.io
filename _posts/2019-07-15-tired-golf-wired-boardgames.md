My mom is an accountant and a lot of people in her office enjoy playing golf.
However, my mom doesn’t play golf so that means to join recreational business
outings that involve golf she’s either aimlessly wandering the playing field or
not participating at all.

This got me thinking, what is the future of business recreation? Will it
continue to be dominated by golf, or is golf as business recreation a
generational thing?

I predict that the future of business recreation in the next 20–50 years will be
boardgames! Boardgames are great, they are:

- **Cheap:** The most expensive games max out around \$60. That’s quite
  reasonable when you have 5–8 players.
- **Inclusive:** Anyone can play! Generally, everyone will be around the same
  experience level. These games are also designed to be fun for newcomers.
- **Collaborative:** A good game will also serve as a team-bonding exercise. You
  can get to know your co-workers better by playing a co-operative game or by
  playing against each other in a hidden information game.
- **Short:** You can pick a game that fits into the time you have. Games with
  quick 30 minute rounds allows parents to play while still getting home to
  their families.
- **Flexible:** All you need is a table, people, and the game. You don’t need a
  full golf course or equipment.

I’m not talking about classic boardgames like Monopoly or Risk. I’m talking
about the _huge_ wave of indie boardgames.

If I’m right, and boardgames become a mainstream part of business recreation,
then the ability to run a boardgame night and introduce new players to the
activity will be pretty valuable.

In this post I’ll share some of my boardgame recommendations, specifically ones
I think would work well in the workplace. I haven’t played all of these…yet. If
you’re in the Bay Area and you’re interested in the future of “business
recreation” we can give one of these a spin.

### One Night Ultimate Werewolf

**Time:** 7 minutes, **Difficulty:** easy, but can become more challenging as
you add roles

My first, and strongest, recommendation is
[One Night Ultimate Werewolf](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00HS7GG5G/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_uNohDb2T9JTWE).
The name is a bit of a mouthful, but all the words actually mean something. I’ll
call it “Werewolf” from here on out.

In Werewolf you have three to eight players and you give everyone a role. Two or
so players will get the “werewolf” role and everyone else will be human
villagers. The humans have five minutes to correctly identify the werewolves. If
the humans discover the werewolves, humans win. Otherwise the werewolves win. So
the werewolves must lie and pretend they are villagers to not get caught. The
game also gives some human roles “powers” like the power to see the role of one
other person or the power to swap two roles.

Werewolf is in the hidden information genre and is actually a very common format
for tabletop games. Growing up, I knew this format as
“[Mafia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)>)” which is a game
you play with a standard deck of 52 playing cards.

However, Werewolf makes a couple big changes which streamlines the format and
makes it much more fun.

- An entire game of Werewolf fits into a single round. Hence why “One Night” is
  in the title. Normally, in a Mafia-style game you have multiple rounds where
  players are progressively eliminated. In a one night format players don’t get
  eliminated so no one has to stop playing!
- Furthermore, you don’t need a game master! Normally, Mafia requires one person
  to run the game to make sure no one is cheating. Werewolf instead comes with
  an app which will run the game for you. That way no one has to sit out during
  play.

These two changes mean everyone in a business recreation setting can play and
can keep playing for multiple rounds. A Werewolf round is also really short
which allows for quick games.

Werewolf is a very collaborative game that’s great for team bonding. You really
need to know the people around you at the table. To know who your allies are and
to know when someone is bluffing. I strongly recommend Werewolf for business
recreation.

### Sheriff of Nottingham

**Time:** 1 hour, **Difficulty:** medium

In
[Sheriff of Nottingham](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B007EZMABG/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_OkphDbWQ2YF59)
every player is a merchant trying to stock their shop with goods. One player is
also the sheriff which rotates to someone else every round. In a round, players
will put some goods into a pouch. For example, three apples. However, players
may also smuggle contraband, like beer, into their pouch! Each player gives
their pouch to the current sheriff and they declare what’s in the pouch. The
sheriff may choose to either believe the player or inspect the player’s pouch.
If there is no contraband in the pouch, the sheriff is fined. If there is
contraband in the pouch, the player who tried to smuggle is fined. Of course,
you can also bribe the sheriff to not inspect your pouch.

If you’ve every played the game
[Cheat (aka BS)](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_(game)>) with a standard
deck of 52 playing cards, then you get the basic idea. You want to smuggle
contraband past the sheriff since contraband is valuable, but you also don’t
want to get caught.

It can take a second to understand all the rules. Make sure one person reads the
rule book ahead of time if you’re in a group of new players.
[You can watch some game play here.](https://youtu.be/Gli9C3HtF44)

The physical elements of the game are very engaging. Whether you’re putting
cards into a pouch and sliding it over to the sheriff, tossing coins over in a
bribe, or popping open the button on a pouch looking for contraband gives an
authentic smuggling experience.

### Captain Sonar

**Time:** 1 hour, **Difficulty:** medium

_Disclaimer: I haven’t played this game._

In
[Captain Sonar](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01EZUCHOC/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_wwphDb18EETTX)
you have two teams made of two to four players with each team piloting a
submarine. Players have roles like navigator, engineer, and sonar operator to
position their submarine against the opponent. The navigator calls out the
direction the submarine is moving on a grid. The enemy sonar operator is
responsible for listening to the opposing captain to record enemy movements.
Once one team believes they have the location of another team they may fire a
torpedo.

So this game is a lot like Battleship except each team only has one submarine
and that submarine is piloted by multiple players.

This game is all about teamwork and communication. With good communication you
can strategically manuever your submarine, with bad communication your opponent
will know exactly what you’re up to. The game can get hectic with a lot of
people talking at once, but that’s also part of the thrill.

### Dominion

**Time:** 30 minutes, **Difficulty:** hard

[Dominion](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01LYLIS2U/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_U_OcqhDbAG7WN2S)
is a deck building game for two to four players. You start with a couple cards
and you slowly buy more, building up your deck. Dominion is a lot like Magic the
Gathering, in fact, it’s frequently marketed with: “Want to play Magic the
Gathering but don’t have the time or money to invest in Magic? Play Dominion
instead!” Which is perfect for me. I love deck building games, but the Magic
investment always intimidated me.

Dominion comes with a bunch of different kinds of cards. You play each game with
a different set of those cards. That means you can have multiple games of
Dominion with _wildly_ different feels depending on the cards you play with.

The game is pretty easy to learn, but there’s a lot of depth, complexity, and
strategy to the game. Especially when you add in expansions. A player can easily
pull ahead of their competitors by employing strategy. This game might be a bit
less inclusive than the others because of that. At some point, you need to start
thinking strategically or you’ll get left behind.

In a workplace, I’d recommend playing Dominion in a tournament format since the
maximum number of players is four.

## Tabletop RPGs

Tabletop RPGs are also a compelling category for business recreation. The most
popular Tabletop RPG is Dungeons & Dragons, but that’s a massive game which can
sprawl over multiple four hour long sessions for years. I think D&D can be great
for building teams in a business setting, but you need commitment.

D&D is not the only Tabletop RPG, though! I recommend watching the
[Tablepop series](https://youtu.be/YqD_oLkrq_8) to get an idea of what shorter
form single session Tabletop RPGs look like.

Here are some of my recommendations beyond D&D. Unfortunately, I don’t have too
many recommendations for Tabletop RPGs that play out over a single session. I’d
like to hear yours!

- [Honey Heist](https://www.docdroid.net/KJzmn5k/honey-heist-by-grant-howitt.pdf):
  You’re a bear pulling off a heist to steal honey from Honeycon. This is a
  fast, fun, one-shot tabletop RPG.
- [Monster of the Week](https://www.evilhat.com/home/monster-of-the-week/):
  You’re a monster hunter and every week there’s a new threat to fight.
  Thematically similar to Buffy the Vampire Slayer and other Monster of the Week
  TV shows. Plays out over multiple sessions.
- [Vampire: The Masquerade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire:_The_Masquerade):
  Players are vampires struggling against their bestial natures. Plays out over
  multiple sessions.

I also think single session Tabletop RPGs could be a fun addition to a tech
conference. You get some well known speakers on stage and run a session. If
you’re a conference organizer interested in exploring this idea more, let me
know.

## Conclusion

If I’m right and boardgames become a mainstream business recreation activity,
then being able to run a boardgame night and introduce new players could be a
valuable skill in a work environment.

So I’m investing into building this skill. I’ll keep you updated on whether or
not it works out for me.
