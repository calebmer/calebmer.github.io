subtitle: "A case for speaking in your writing"
summary: "Words are hard. Not as in the difficulty, but as in a jagged rock type of hard. They will hit you over the head again and again. Emojis are soft, round, and squishy. They can take the edge off of your words, all you have to do is let them."

The English language fascinates me. A collection of 26 letters compose *all* forms of human thought. Think about that. Then think about the fact that those 26 symbols define your thoughts as they pass through your head.

So many novels, records, academic essays, even code is based upon this exclusive set. So much human knowledge, condensed down into 26 shapes.

Yet somehow it is not enough.

Communication, human interaction, through just words is hard.

“Hey dork,” Bob types.

“What’s up loser,” types Joe.

Who are Bob and Joe, two dudes in a deep bromance, or mortal enemies?

When one texts, emails, comments, writes a letter, telegrams (if that’s the verb) they lose out on entire depths of communication we take for granted. Eye contact, facial expression, body language, vocal inflection. All of that turns into 26 letters on paper.

Thus enters emoji :)

One of the most prominent inventions of the 21st century, emojis are more then annoying yellow circles, or a clever arrangement of the symbols represented by our keyboards. Emojis reintroduce feeling into our digital conversations.

“Super excited”

“Super excited :D”

Emojis also make us better liars.

Normally in your communication you do not get the affordance of time to form a statement. When you communicate by text&mdash;time and emojis are the two things in excess.

We have time to process our words before they leave us. Time to reason out the consequences. Time to set the tone with an emoji icon. Time to craft other’s perceptions of us, something we could never do with face to face contact.

Time to realize other’s have no perception of us at all.

Comment sections. Known for their ability to bring out the worst in us. This is because the people who read our comments will likely never recognize our name should they encounter it a second time. This is a result of comment sections being an afterthought, and not a crucial part to the interaction of a web page.

We can all communicate better through text. Text gives you the opportunity to express exactly who you are. Do not take it lightly. If you have to assume something about the person on the opposite screen in order for your message to be interpreted. Rewrite.

Because unlike person to person communication, communication by text gives you the ability to clarify everything the *first* time. No backtracking, no apologies are necessary.

Get over it, and use your emoji.
