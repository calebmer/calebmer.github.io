Hi, Iâ€™m Caleb Meredith ðŸ‘‹

I previously was at Facebook where I worked on:

- [Flow][flow]
- [Prepack][prepack]
- [Oculus Go][oculus-go]

I also was a core contributor on the [Apollo Client][apollo-client], built the
initial versions of [PostGraphile][postgraphile], and partnered with [G2i][g2i]
on several contract projects.

[Baruch-Adi Hen](http://www.baruchadi.com) is my blogging accountability partner
ðŸ˜‰

Cheers!
